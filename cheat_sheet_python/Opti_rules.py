# 20 Useful Techniques for Writing Performant and Expressive Code

# Technique 1: Use List Comprehensions or Generator Expressions for concise and efficient iteration.

# Technique 2: Leverage built-in functions and libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel.

# Technique 3: Employ slicing to efficiently access or manipulate portions of lists or strings.

# Technique 4: Utilize the map() function to apply a function to each element of an iterable.

# Technique 5: Use set operations (intersection, union, difference) for efficient set manipulation.

# Technique 6: Take advantage of the collections module for specialized data structures (e.g., Counter, defaultdict).

# Technique 7: Employ memoization to cache expensive function calls and improve performance.

# Technique 8: Utilize context managers (with statement) to ensure proper resource cleanup.

# Technique 9: Employ appropriate data structures (e.g., dictionaries, sets) for efficient membership testing.

# Technique 10: Use tuple unpacking to easily assign multiple variables in a single line.

# Technique 11: Employ the zip() function to iterate over multiple sequences in parallel.

# Technique 12: Utilize the enumerate() function to access both the index and value of an iterable in a loop.

# Technique 13: Leverage the power of regular expressions for advanced string matching and manipulation.

# Technique 14: Employ functools.partial to create specialized functions with pre-set arguments.

# Technique 15: Use generator functions to create memory-efficient iterators.

# Technique 16: Employ the timeit module to measure the execution time of code snippets.

# Technique 17: Optimize performance-critical code using algorithmic improvements or caching results.

# Technique 18: Employ appropriate data structures (e.g., deque) for efficient queue or stack operations.

# Technique 19: Utilize the bisect module for efficient insertion into and searching within sorted sequences.

# Technique 20: Employ decorators to add additional functionality to functions or classes without modifying their code.
