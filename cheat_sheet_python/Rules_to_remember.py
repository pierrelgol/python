# Rule 1
print("Rule 1: Indentation matters in Python. Use consistent and correct indentation.")

# Rule 2
print("Rule 2: Beware of mutable default arguments in function definitions.")

# Rule 3
print("Rule 3: Be cautious with floating-point arithmetic due to precision limitations.")

# Rule 4
print("Rule 4: Understand the difference between 'is' and '==' for object comparison.")

# Rule 5
print("Rule 5: Be aware of the behavior of mutable and immutable objects in function calls.")

# Rule 6
print("Rule 6: Avoid using '== None' or '!= None'. Use 'is None' or 'is not None' instead.")

# Rule 7
print("Rule 7: Take care when using the 'is' operator with small integers.")

# Rule 8
print("Rule 8: Be mindful of the order of operations and precedence in complex expressions.")

# Rule 9
print("Rule 9: Be cautious with mutable objects as dictionary keys.")

# Rule 10
print("Rule 10: Avoid using 'from module import *'. It pollutes the namespace.")

# Rule 11
print("Rule 11: Be careful when modifying a list while iterating over it.")

# Rule 12
print("Rule 12: Understand the behavior of 'and' and 'or' operators for conditional statements.")

# Rule 13
print("Rule 13: Be aware of the differences between 'is' and '==' for string comparisons.")

# Rule 14
print("Rule 14: Use 'isinstance()' for type checking instead of comparing types directly.")

# Rule 15
print("Rule 15: Be cautious with the behavior of the '+=', '*= ', and similar operators for mutable objects.")

# Rule 16
print("Rule 16: Avoid modifying a sequence (e.g., list) while iterating over it with 'for' loop.")

# Rule 17
print("Rule 17: Understand the behavior of 'None' and 'False' in boolean expressions.")

# Rule 18
print("Rule 18: Be aware of the differences between 'append()' and 'extend()' methods for lists.")

# Rule 19
print("Rule 19: Pay attention to the scope of variables inside and outside of functions.")

# Rule 20
print("Rule 20: Be cautious with the behavior of '==', 'is', and 'in' operators for NaN values.")
